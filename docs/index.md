I started my clinical career in 2010 when I graduated with my Associate Degree in Nursing. During my 10+ years of clinical experience I earned a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and a Bachelor of Science in Health Informatics.

In my recent position as a Quality Assurance Coordinator and RN Trainer, I started to develop a passion for managing, analyzing, and reporting data. As my experience with Excel, Microsoft Access, & SQL grew, I decided to focus on becoming proficient in data analytics.

This website is a portfolio of projects that cultivated my analytical skills and demonstrates my skills as a data analyst.

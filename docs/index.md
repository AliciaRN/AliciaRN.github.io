## Welcome to My Portfolio on GitHub Pages
## Alicia RN-Data Analysis

I started my clinical career in 2010 when I graduated with my Associate Degree in Nursing. During my 10+ years of clinical experience I earned a Bachelor’s of Science in Nursing and a Bachelor’s Degree in Healthcare Informatics.

In my recent position as a Quality Assurance Coordinator and RN Trainer, I started to develop my skills in data analysis.

As I continue to develop my technical skills, I will use this website as a portfolio to show case my projects.

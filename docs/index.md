## Welcome to My Portfolio on GitHub Pages
## Alicia RN-Data Analysis

I started my clinical career in 2010 when I graduated with my Associate Degree in Nursing. During my 10+ years of clinical experience I earned a Bachelors of Science in Nursing and a Bachelors Degree in Healthcare Informatics. 

In my recent position as a Quality Assurance Coordinator and RN Trainer, I started to develop my skills in data analaysis. 

As I contiue to develop my technical skills, I will use this website as a portfolio to show case my projects.
